Here you'll find all the steel RODS we use for the xBot-Medium

The .STP files for the RODS are mostly just in place for the sake of it.

The PDF files contains all relevant measurements for the rods.

Do use some high quality Ground Steel h6 rods and not some generic "chromed steel" bars from china.
