Here you'll find all the RODS and Steel plates used to keep the Z-rods in place.
The Motorshields are also in here for now.

The .STP files for the RODS are mostly just in place for the sake of it.

The PDF files contains all relevant measurements for the rods.

Do use some high quality Chromed Steel h6 rods and not some generic "chromed steel" bars from china.
