The various metal/aluminium pieces are found in here.

I've intended the Motorshields to be made in material 0.5-1mm thickness. 
As long as the outer measurements are the same, the thickness doesn't really matter.

There are 2 different versions of the Z 8mm and Z 12mm endcaps:
I did this as it can be hard to find someone who can make these small pieces in steel.

1) First version are made up of 2mm thick steel brackets.
2) Second version are made up of 4mm thick aluminium brackets.
