The plates used to build the frame of the xBot Medium printer

The PDF files are mostly descriptive in nature, where you'll use the .STP files for the actual measurements.

Remember there are lots of partical cuts, so you need a CNC facility who can handle this kind of compound material.

NOTE:
The Door for the front is a cut out part of the TOP frane piece.
The rear Z-Gantry shield is a cut out part of the FRONT frame piece.
