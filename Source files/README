Here you'll find all the custom source files for the project in .STP and .PDF format. 

The PDF files are mainly explnanatory while you will need the .STP files for the actual measurements.
Some PDF files contains information on threads, like the Z-gantry and brackets for the Z-rods.

I have not yet recieved all parts and can't upload all the .STP files untill I do.
